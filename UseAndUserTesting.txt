How to use our feature:

To add a new rating, each reviewer will just go to the comment section and leave reviews on any of the different axis as wanted. We have included three different ways to rate a student (skill, experience, and GPA), all with an equal weight on the final score. To update the skill or experience score, the reviewer changes the drop down and press submit. To edit the GPA, the reviewer writes in the text box a number (that can have decimal points) between 0 and 4. If the reviewer doesn't write a number that fits the criteria, an alert will be displayed.

When one reviewer updates a score, that score will be updated for all of the different reviewers. Thus, the reviewers should use the comment section to negotiate and settle on a final score that they all agree on.


User Testing Protocol:

To test our feature, we will ask a user to pretend that they are a reviewer looking at the students' resume and think aloud as they perform the task. 
We will ask the participant to perform these tasks:
1. Look over the resume and add a GPA score.
2. Add an experience score.
3.1 (If the participant had a score of more than one for task 2) Change your experience score to be one star lower.
3.2 (If the participant had a score of one for task 2) Change your experience score to be one star higher.
4. Add a skill score.
5. Change your skill score to 5 stars.
