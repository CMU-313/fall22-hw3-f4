User Testing Protocol:

Single rating
To test single rating, we will ask a user to pretend that they are a reviewer looking at the students' resume and think aloud as they perform the task. 

We will ask the participant to perform these tasks:
1. Look over the resume and add a rating.
2. Change your rating to be one star lower.
